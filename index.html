				<span class="SiteText">Parrot Games is a development team consisting of six members: Peter, Mike, Tinus, Celesta, Jonathan and Li-Yeun. All of us are first year students at Utrecht University. Our team was created for the course Gametechnologie introductieproject. For this course we were asked to make a game based on a retro game. The purpose of this course is to learn how to make a game as a real company, starting with a simple idea and ending with promoting our final result. We learned a lot about working in a team and programming in general.<br>&nbsp;</span>

				<span class="BodyTitle">About the game</span><br><br>
				<span class="SiteText">Our game 'Ghosts vs Pacman' is an improved version of Pacman. We added 3D to the game, so now you can actually run through the maze instead of just hovering above it. We also changed the game from a single player game to a multiplayer game in which up to five people can play against each other. Lastly, we added a bunch of power-ups to the game to make it more interesting. <br><br>

				Multiplayer introduces tons of new possibilities. You can locally play with up to five people. One player will control Pacman, while the others each control one of the ghosts. While Pacman tries to eat all the pellets, the ghosts have to try and work together to catch Pacman until heâ€™s out of lives. Pacman as well as the ghosts have access to several different power-ups to help win the match, such as speed boosts, ways to go over or through walls, tricks to confuse your opponents and more.<br>
